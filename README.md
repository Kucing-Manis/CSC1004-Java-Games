Creating A Rock Paper Scissor RPG Game 

Inspired by the game Slice & Dice.

Idea:

Creating an RPG turn base game with rock, paper, and scissor. 
My idea is to do an infinite level where when the players defeat the enemy, the players will go to the next stage and fight harder enemies. 

Game Mechanism:

Let call rock, paper, scissor as shapes.

First, the player will pick one shape, The enemies will also pick one shape randomly (Maybe some enemies will be coded to have personalities or specialty. For instance, the enemy have a speciality, resulted in him picking scissor more often than the others). When the player win, the player have a chance to pick to get a turn or do random rolls. In random rolls, player can get item but lose the turn, a turn with power up (Such as two times damage for one turn), and also bad result (Such as lose a turn while the enemy get a turn). If the player draw, then both the player and the enemy will get a turn. If the player lose, the enemy will get a turn while the player don’t. 

To make the game more interesting, I will probably add a special ability call “trick”. This ability will allow the player two pick two shapes rather than one. If the first option that the player pick loses, then it will automatically change it into the second option. If the first option that the player pick draw, the player will be given a choice to stay with the first option or change into the second option. If the first option that the player pick win, then nothing happens. This special probability will probably be limited either by cooldown or the amount that can be used in one stage.
